# Matlab_Applied

Here are few (simplified) examples on ENGINEER:\
## SEMICONDUCTORS: 
I_D / V_D_S curves for MOFSET and Termal distribution in a chip with squared heat source (file 'mofsetBase' and 'T_distrib_in_chip_with_squared_heat_source')

## Physical Chemistry:
Ferromagnetic domains in a Co sphere and DOS in Sommerfeld model (file 'FerromagneticDomainStructureinCobaltSphere' and 'sommerfeld')

## NUCLEAR FUSION:
Magnetic fields in a Tokamak and in a Stellarator (file 'BStellarator' and 'BTokamakePlasmaCurrent')
